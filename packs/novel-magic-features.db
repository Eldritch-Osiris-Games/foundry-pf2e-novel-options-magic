{"name":"Theurge Spellcasting","type":"feat","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.vhr8bGcwxJkGD3qu"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Through dedicated study and practice, you can harness internal magical power to cast spells. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells (see Casting Spells).</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you must prepare four 1st-level spells and four cantrips each morning from the spells in your&nbsp;spellbook (see below). For every level of spell you can prepare, including cantrips, each spell must appear on a different spell list. For example, you could prepare magic missile as a 1st level arcane spell, but then you could not prepare summon construct in any other 1st level slot because it is only on the arcane spell list. You could, however, prepare magic missile as a 1st level arcane spell and fear as a 1st level occult spell, despite both spells appearing on both lists.</p>\n<p>Prepared spells remain available until you cast them or until you cast two spells of the same spell level from your class spell slots, or until you prepare your spells again. Whenever you gain access to a new level of spells, you can prepare four spells of that level. Unlike most spellcasters, the number of spells you prepare and the number of spells you can cast are different (see table 2-5). The number of spells you can cast per day are called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>Because you are constantly manipulating multiple, and sometimes opposing essences, you have some limitations on when you can cast the spells you have prepared. Before you cast your first spell for the day, but after daily preparations, you can cast any of your prepared spells. However, once you cast a spell you become locked to the tradition of spellcasting you prepared that spell as until you use the Break Tradition activity. This effect and restriction applies to all abilities that allow you to cast magic, such as innate spells or multiclass archetypes, as well as magical items such as scrolls, wands, and staves.</p>\n<p>Because you cast from multiple traditions, all spells you cast use your proficiency rank in theurge spellcasting.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a theurge, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast&nbsp;from spell slots increase, shown in Table 2-5: Theurge Spells per Day.</p>\n<h3><strong>HEIGHTENING SPELLS</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they're heightened to certain levels.</p>\n<h3><strong>CANTRIPS</strong></h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up&mdash;this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a theurge. For example, as a 1st-level theurge, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level theurge, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<h2>Spellbook</h2>\n<p>Every spell has a written version, usually recorded in a spellbook. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study to prepare your spells each day. The spellbook contains your choice of 8 cantrips and four 1st-level spells. You choose these from the common spells on any spell list from this book or from other spells you have access to. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be a musty, leather-bound tome or an assortment of thin metal disks connected to a brass ring; its name might be esoteric, like The Crimson Libram, or something more academic, like A Field Study in Practical Transmutation. Each time you gain an odd level, you add four more spells to your spellbook, of any level you can cast. You can also use the Arcana skill to add arcane spells, Nature to add primal spells, Occultism to add occult spells, and Religion to add divine spells that you find in your adventures (See Learn a Spell).&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Table 2-5: Theurge Spells Per Day</h2>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\" style=\"width: 100%;

You can cast divine spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells (see Casting Spells). Because you're a zealot, you can usually hold a divine focus (such as a religious symbol) or your deity&rsquo;s favored weapon for spells requiring material components instead of needing to use a material component pouch.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can prepare one 1st-level spell and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the divine spell list in the Core Rulebook or from other divine spells to which you gain access. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a zealot, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase, shown in Table 2&ndash;2: Zealot Spells per Day. Because you split your focus between physical training and religious prayer, you have no more than two spell slots of your highest level and, if you can cast 2nd-level spells or higher, two spell slots of 1 level lower than your highest spell level.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or your enemies to roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Wisdom, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in Spell Attack Rolls.</p>\n<h2>HEIGHTENING SPELLS</h2>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they're heightened to certain levels.</p>\n<h2>CANTRIPS</h2>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up&mdash;this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a zealot.

Your alignment must be one allowed by your deity, as listed in their entry. Your deity grants you the trained proficiency rank in one skill and with the deity's favored weapon. If the favored weapon is uncommon, you also get access to that weapon. Your deity also adds spells to your spell list. You can prepare these just like you can any spell on the divine spell list, once you can prepare spells of their level as a zealot. Some of these spells aren't normally on the divine list, but they're divine spells if you prepare them this way.</p>\n<h2>ANATHEMA</h2>\n<p>Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's alignment or ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces. Casting spells with the evil trait is almost always anathema to good deities, and casting good spells is likewise anathema to evil deities; similarly, casting chaotic spells is anathema to lawful deities, and casting lawful spells is anathema to chaotic deities. A neutral zealot who worships a neutral deity isn't limited this way, but their alignment might change over time if they frequently cast spells or use abilities with a certain alignment. Similarly, casting spells that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, casting a spell to create undead would be anathema to a goddess of death. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine which acts are anathema. If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, or if your alignment changes to one not allowed by your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your divine fervor, divine force, and all divine spellcasting.
